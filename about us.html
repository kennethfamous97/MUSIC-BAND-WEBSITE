            Transport Layer
        The following are the main protocols for the transport layer:
        • UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is a connectionless protocol that is different from TCP/IP in that
        it provides few error recovery services. It can broadcast datagrams over an IP network.
        • TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a main component in TCP/IP networks. The reliable,
        connection-oriented protocol mainly involves dealing with packets sent from one system to another. The
        TCP protocol enables two hosts to create a connection and exchange different types of data.
        Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and Application Layer
        The following are the main protocols for the session layer, presentation layer, and application layer:
        • HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the standard used by the World Wide Web to transfer
        massages. This protocol defines the way in which messages are transmitted. The protocol also defines
        the actions browsers are required to take for various other commands.
        • SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is the standard for sending e-mail between servers. Sys-
        tems on the Internet make use of this protocol to send e-mail from one server to another.
        • NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol): NNTP is the standard protocol for distributing and recover-
        ing Usenet messages.
        • Telnet: Telnet is a

        Data Link Layer
        The following are the main protocols for the data link layer:
        • Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): It is the standard for the transport of IP traffic over point-to-point links.
        It consists of three main components:
        1. High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol is used by PPP to sum up the data between the
        source and destination links.
        2. Link Control Protocol is used in establishing, configuring, and testing the data link connection
        between the source and the destination IP address.
        3. Network Control Protocols (NCPs) are used to negotiate options for network layer protocols running
        on top of PPP.
        • Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP): IP packets were relayed over dial-up lines using SLIP. SLIP was re-
        placed by PPP.
        • Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): ARP is considered a part of the data link layer, even though it is a
        part of TCP/IP.
